# Coin-Clicker-Game
A crappy idle coin clicker game

This is a simple coin clicker game that I made in like a day. I literally wrote the base code in a note on my phone when I was stuck in traffic, so yeah... it's not the best. I've managed to add enough polish and fanciness to make it feel and look complete so I'm done with this project now. 
If anybody wants to add to it, feel free. There is no license to this so you can do whatever you want to it.

# Controls
If on a computer, **SPACE** toggles debug logging. Any utterly useless feature but it was a fun way to log all the print statements I liberally sprinkled throughout the code.
Otherwise, just **CLICK**.
